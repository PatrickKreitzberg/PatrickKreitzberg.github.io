# INTRODUCTION
This was created by Patrick Kreitzberg under the guidance of Dr. Jesse Johnson at the University of Montana.  The program is a tool to help create data profiles using a gui. yada yada

# DATA
(Place in ./data directory)  
All data is the dataset with all the underlying data.  It is an hdf5 file with the velocity, surface, bed etc. data as numpy arrays.  The currently available dataset have a larger resolution ~900m.  A larger dataset with 150m resolution will be available soon.

The colormap data file is also a hdf5 file but the data are 8bit length 3 RGB arrays.  There is a colormap for each of the underlying data sets.  The colormaps are full resolution so the file size is 2.5 GB.

# Markers
The markers select your path along which data will be examined.  To mark a spot click on the map wherever.  Multiple clicks will create multiple spots which will automatically form a line between each successive marker.  
* <b>Create:</b> click on map.  
* <b>Remove:</b> ctrl + click on marker.  
* <b>Move:</b> click once on marker to pick it up then again to place it down.  
* <b>Integrate:</b> shift + click to create a line from the marker which follows the velocity flow.  
* <b>Snap:</b> move a marker near an integrate line then click when it snaps to line.
