# INTRODUCTION
This was created by Patrick Kreitzberg under the guidance of Dr. Jesse Johnson at the University of Montana.  The program is a tool to help create data profiles using a gui. yada yada

# DATA
(Place in ./data directory)  
All data is the dataset with all the underlying data.  It is an hdf5 file with the velocity, surface, bed etc. data as numpy arrays.  The currently available dataset have a larger resolution ~900m.  A larger dataset with 150m resolution will be available soon.

The colormap data file is also a hdf5 file but the data are 8bit length 3 RGB arrays.  There is a colormap for each of the underlying data sets.  The colormaps are full resolution so the file size is 2.5 GB.

# UI Features

1. Colormap image with key  
2. Map drop down selection
* Select colormap of different data sets (bed elevation, surface elevation, etc.)

<a name="markers"></a>
# Markers
The markers select your path along which data will be examined.  To mark a spot click on the map wherever.  Multiple clicks will create multiple spots which will automatically form a line between each successive marker.  
* <b>Create:</b> click on map.  
* <b>Remove:</b> ctrl + click on marker.  
* <b>Move:</b> click once on marker to pick it up then again to place it down.  
* <b>Integrate:</b> shift + click to create a line from the marker which follows the velocity flow.  
* <b>Snap:</b> move a marker near an integrate line then click when it snaps to line.

# TO DO
* <b>Antartic data</b>
    * Email bryce noel about RACMO SMB and t2m datasets.
    * Find which papers to reference
* User script to create data file of certain resolution
* <b>SPEED</b>
    * up in any way (higher resolution data)
    * Hh5py in parallel? http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/mpi.html
    * Auto-load smaller colormap with cmd line option for full
* Pick white integration path to graph/model
* Add sliding parameters/changes to surface mass balance
* Check that it obeys the resolution input each time
* Change surface to being above the geoid not above average sea level
* Add checkbox to remove used colormaps from memory 
* <b>MODEL</b>
    * Pause/play button for model run-back
* <b>STATIC PLOTTER</b>
    * Don't always create 3 plots.  Can do more or less
    * Right side panel max width
    * Could do 6 grid boxes with 5 plots and 1 for buttons 
* <b>BUGS</b>
    * Plot path, remove 'plot all' then click plot velocity width then plot -> crashes
    * Mesh can get a 'reduced to zero array' error -> find out how to trigger and fix/give instructions  
    * Each time velocity map loads it comes from RAM.  Each time bed map loads it comes from the SSD
* <b>CMD LINE</b>
    * Option to use low-res colormaps
    * Option to not use multiprocessing when loading interpolators
